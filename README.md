# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## My Creation
Welcome to Dicee, a Flutter project where I applied my programming skills to create a fun and interactive mobile app.

## What I Built
I've developed a Las Vegas-style dice app that's always ready to roll the dice at a tap of a button. With this app in my pocket, I can settle any score or make decisions on the fly!


## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply various programming concepts, including:

- Utilizing Flutter stateless widgets to design a user-friendly interface.
- Implementing Flutter stateful widgets to infuse dynamic updates into the app.
- Tweaking widget properties to achieve the desired look and behavior.
- Incorporating onClick listeners to respond to button taps.
- Embracing `setState()` to mark the widget tree for updates, ensuring a responsive user experience.
- Adapting widgets to different screen dimensions using the `expanded` widget.
- Mastering string interpolation for dynamic data display.
- Exploring core Dart programming concepts, including data types and functions.
- Enhancing user interaction through gesture controls.

Dicee is not just an app; it's a testament to my growing programming skills. With this foundation, I'm ready to tackle even more exciting app development projects! ðŸŽ²ðŸš€
